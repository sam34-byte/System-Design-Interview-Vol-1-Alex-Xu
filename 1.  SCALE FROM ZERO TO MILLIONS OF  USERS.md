#### Single Server Setup 

![[single-server-setup.png]]

	1. Users access websites through domain names, such as api.mysite.com. Usually, the Domain Name System (DNS) is a paid service provided by 3rd parties and not hosted by our servers. 

	2. Internet Protocol (IP) address is returned to the browser or mobile app. In the example, IP address 15.125.23.214 is returned. 

	3. Once the IP address is obtained, Hypertext Transfer Protocol requests are sent directly to your web server. 4. The web server returns HTML pages or JSON response for rendering.

The traffic to your web server comes from two sources  : 

	Web Application : uses a combination of server-side languages(Java, Python, etc.) to handle business logic, storage, etc., and client-side languages (HTML and JavaScript) for presentation.

	Mobile Application : HTTP protocol is the communication protocol between the mobile app and the web server. JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is commonly used API response format to transfer data due to its simplicity.

Example of JSON API response : 
GET/users/12 - Retrieve user object for id = 12

```
{
	"id" : 12,
	"firstName" : "John",
	"lastName" : "Smith", 
	"address" :{
		"streetAddress" : "21 2nd Street", 
		"city" : "New York",
		"state" : "NY"
	}
}
```

#### Database

With the growth of the user base, one server is not enough, and we need multiple servers: one for web/mobile traffic, the other for the database.

Separating web/mobile traffic (web tier) and database (data tier) servers allows them to be scaled independently.

#### Which databases to use ?

Relational databases(RDBMS) represent and store data in tables and row. You can perform join operations using SQL across different database tables.

Ex : MySQL, Oracle database, PostgreSQL etc.

Non-Relational databases(NoSQL) are grouped into four categories : 
- key-value stores
- column stores
- graph stores
- document stores

Join operations are generally not supported in non-relational databases.

Non-relational databases might be the right choice if: 
- application requires super-low latency
- data are unstructured, or you do not have any relational data
- only need to serialize and deserialize data(JSON, XML, YAML etc.)
- store a massive amount of data 

#### Vertical Scaling vs Horizontal Scaling
